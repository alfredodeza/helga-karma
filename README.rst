Helga Karma
===========

Modeled after `PMXBot <https://bitbucket.org/yougov/pmxbot>`_'s karma plugin,
but just a little bit better.

Commands
--------

``!t[hanks] <nickname>``
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thank somebody for doing a good job!

Example::

    youthere> I've just fitzbangled the horsemonster for you, person.
    person>   !thanks youthere
    helga>    You're doing good work, youthere!

Also has an alias -- ``!m[otivate]`` -- for situations in which somebody
hasn't yet done the thing you're appreciative of or otherwise just
needs motivation::

    youthere> I'm having an awful day; I've orangeenveloped the
              twinkleverse like a dozen times so far and it's not even
              noon!
    somebody> !m youthere
    helga>    You're doing good work, youthere!
    somebody> It'll be OK, buddy; it's Friday.

The people you've thanked (or motivated) will get a little bump in their
karma (and that bump is variable depending on the ratio of times you --
the thanker -- have thanked others vs. the number of times you've been
thanked).

``!k[arma] [details] [for] [<nick>]``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Get a user's Karma information.

Example::

    person> I wonder how much karma I have.
    person> !karma
    helga>  person has about 24 karma, person.

You can also ask about another person's karma::

    person> I wonder how much karma somebody has.
    person> !karma somebody
    helga>  somebody has about 10 karma, person.

And, if you're curious about the details, you can ask for those, too, and
even abbreviate the command itself::

    person> I wonder if somebody has every thanked anybody in his life.
    person> !k details somebody
    helga>  somebody has 10.1 karma.  (thanked others 20 times, received
            thanks 12 times, karma coefficient: 0.6, aliases: adam,
            coddingtonbear)

``!k[arma] top [10]``
+++++++++++++++++++++

Get a list of people ordered by how much karma they have.

Example::

    person> Let's see who's the most helpful around here.
    person> !karma top 3
    helga> #1: somebody (2213 karma) | #2: somebody_else (2013 karma) |
           #3: whoisthis (1408 karma)
    person> Not me :-(

``!k[arma] alias <nick1> <nick2>``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Link two nicknames together to share the same karma values.  This is commonly
used for away nicknames.

Example::

    person> !karma coddingtonbear==coddingtonbear_away
    helga>  coddingtonbear and coddingtonbear_away are now linked, person.

``!k[arma] unalias <nick1> <nick2>``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Unlink two nicknames from one another.

Example::

    person> !karma coddingtonbear!=coddingtonbear_away
    helga>  coddingtonbear and coddingtonbear_away are now unlinked, person.


Settings
--------

``KARMA_MESSAGE_OVERRIDES``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can override the existing messages by adding dictionary entries to
this dictionary matching the name of existing messages.
See ``helga_karma.plugin.MESSAGES`` for existing messages.

The following example changes the default 'info_none' message from
"I'm not aware of {for_nick} having done anything helpful, {nick}." to
one that is slightly less polite::

    KARMA_MESSAGE_OVERRIDES = {
        'info_none': '{for_nick} is useless, {nick}'
    }

``KARMA_VALUE_NAME``
++++++++++++++++++++

Set this to a string to replace the word 'karma' in all messages.

To make helga-karma behave more like MeowMeowBeenz, you would add
the following setting::

    KARMA_VALUE_NAME='MeowMeowBeenz'

``KARMA_COEFFICIENT_NAME``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set this to a string to replace the word 'karma coefficient' in the detailed
per-user karma report.

To make helga-karma behave more like MeowMeowBeenz, you could add the
following setting::

    KARMA_COEFFICIENT_NAME='5 Factor'

``KARMA_SCALED_RANGE``
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set this to a 2-tuple of values between which all users' karma should be
continuously distributed.

To make helga-karma behave more like MeowMeowBeenz (in which all
users have karma values ranging between one and five), you could
add the following setting::

    KARMA_SCALED_RANGE=(1, 5)


``KARMA_SCALE_LINEAR``
++++++++++++++++++++++

Set this to a truthy value to scale karma linearly.  By default, karma will
be scaled logarithmically across the range::

    KARMA_SCALE_LINEAR=True
